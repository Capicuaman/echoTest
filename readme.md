# Organizing a multi-page website using the Echo framework

structuring your routes, templates, and handlers effectively.


## Run the Application

Navigate to your project directory and run the application:

```bash
go run main.go
```

## Access the Website

Open your web browser and access the following URLs:

- `http://localhost:8080` for the home page.
- `http://localhost:8080/about` for the about page.
- `http://localhost:8080/contact` for the contact page.

Each page will use the base template and render its specific content.

By organizing your project with separate handlers, templates, and static files, you create a maintainable and scalable structure for your multi-page website using the Echo framework.
